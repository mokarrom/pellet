QC-OWL: An Inconsistency-tolerant Description Logic for Java
-----------------------------------------------

QC-OWL is a paraconsistent (inconsistent-tolerant) reasoner that can handle inconsistency directly. It is based on a non-classical semantics called quasi-classical description logic (QCDL) proposed for handling inconsistency in description logics. 
 
* [open source](https://github.com/mokarrom/qc-owl/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) (AGPL)
* pure Java
* developed on top of [Pellet](https://github.com/Complexible/pellet). 

QC-OWL can perform reasoning over both consistent and inconsistent ontologies with an acceptable to a very good performance for the DL SHIQ. It is designed and developed by following the Strategy Pattern, a behavioral design pattern, and is based on the core framework of [Pellet](https://github.com/Complexible/pellet), a widely used complete OWL-DL reasoner. To the best of our knowledge, QC-OWL is the first paraconsistent (inconsistency-tolerant) reasoner that can handle inconsistency directly with reasonable inference power.
